# WTube
Invidious client for Windows Phone devices, very basic at the moment.

Tested on 8.1, unknown if it'll work on 10.

## Why?
I am well aware that there's another more common and popular client.

It crashes for me, i don't know why and i can't fix it so i just made one for myself, i don't like to use youtube without a proper app.
