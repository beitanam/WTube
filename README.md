# WTube
A invidious client for Windows Phone.

Works with 8.1, no idea if it works on 10.

Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/starterbeeee/WTube/releases).
## Why?
I am well aware that there's another more common and popular client.

It crashes for me, i don't know why and i can't fix it so i just made one for myself, i don't like to use youtube without a proper app.
